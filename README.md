# W3-The-Band

This repository contains a clone of the [W3Schools Band Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm). The purpose of this project is to practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by replicating a real website layout.

You can visit W3-The-Band from [here](https://zybacon.github.io/W3-The-Band-F8-Learning/).

## Project Overview

The project is a static website that aims to recreate the layout, design, and functionality of the "Band" template from W3Schools using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This clone project was built from scratch as a practice exercise.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
-   **CSS**: To style the website, focusing on layout, color schemes, and responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript**: To add interactivity where necessary.

## Features

-   **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts for various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile and tablet devices.
-   **Navigation Bar**: A functional navigation bar that allows users to quickly access different sections of the website.
-   **Stylized Sections**: Each section of the page is styled to replicate the original design as closely as possible.
